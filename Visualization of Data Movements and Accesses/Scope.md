**Topic Kind:** Overview

**Motivation:**
 - Applications and therefore their performance analysis grow more complex every year
 - Data movements and access patterns can heavily impact performance
 - Visualization tools can provide a visual representation of the data accesses <br> -> help to identify performance issues

**Thesis Content:**
 - Present multiple different data access visualization  
approaches  
 - Discuss their advantages and disadvantages  
 - Compare the approaches against each other

 - Larger Focus on Data Gathering

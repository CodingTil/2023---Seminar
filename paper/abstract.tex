\noindent The widening processor-memory performance gap and the increasing complexity of programs necessitate better data locality optimization methods for efficient computation. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of visualization techniques for data movements and accesses to aid in data locality optimization. It includes methods of data gathering like dynamic analysis, static analysis, and simulation, and discusses their usage in various visualization tools at different granularities. Three specific tools are detailed, providing unique perspectives on data movement visualization. The paper further outlines the standard performance optimization workflow and provides an outlook on future enhancements in data gathering, visualizations, and automated program optimization.

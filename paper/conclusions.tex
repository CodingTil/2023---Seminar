\textit{Future Work:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Gathering and Visualizations can always be improved
	\item But we can use the gathered data to automatically optimize programs (reference to paper) â†’ Even less work for the programmer (who might be just a domain researcher)
	\item Deep Learning is also being experimented with to automatically optimize programs at compile time (reference to paper)
\end{itemize}

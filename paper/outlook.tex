\section{Outlook and Future Work}\label{sec:outlook}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data Gathering and Visualizations can always be improved
  \item But we can use the gathered data to automatically optimize programs (reference to paper) -> Even less work for the programmer (who might be just a domain researcher)
  \item Deep Learning is also being experimented with to automatically optimize programs at compile time (reference to paper)
\end{itemize}

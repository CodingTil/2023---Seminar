\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem_statement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increasing Processor-Memory Speed Gap (\ref{sec:pmgap}) and increasing requirements (\ref{sec:comp_mem_req}) result in a large increase in the affect of data movement costs and their resulting bottlenecks. While breakthroughs in hardware research can improve this issue, software engineers can also try to mitigate these issues by improving data locality (\ref{sec:data_locality}) through software.
  \item Increasing complexity of programs makes it difficult to create a mental model of the data movement of a program. This makes it challenging for experts and impossible for domain researchers to optimize such a program.
\end{itemize}
